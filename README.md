    check its **IP adress** using the command `ipconfig`.
  - In `server/server.py` Replace the IP adress in the `__init__` function with your IP adress.

  **AS A CLIENT**
  - In the `pages` folder, open the `login_page.py` file, and replace the IP in the `__init__` function with the server IP.


## How to play
- Open the `Game` folder in VS-Code or any other python compiler.
- Open the `server` folder and run the `server.py` file.
- In the main path, run `main.py` file.
- **If you want to have another player against you**, run the `main.py` file again, in the other computer or in yours.
- Keep in mind, if you run the server and 2 clients on one PC, it can have a strain on your computer.
  **Make sure you write the IP address correctly**.
